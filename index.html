        We are committed to ensuring transparency in how we process your data.
        Because we use many of the same online services as you, we know that lack of information and overly complex
        wording are the most common privacy policy issues. We take a completely opposite approach: the text of our

        and understand how we apply them.

          simplicity, in this privacy policy, they are collectively referred to as “services”. In order to make it
          clearer for you, we have added links to this privacy policy on all relevant services.
          Some services may have their own privacy policies. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then
          the service policy will be in effect, not this privacy policy.</li>

          processed by us.
          • When you sign up for a paid service or make a purchase directly from our site (and not through platforms
          such as iOS or Android), you provide us or a payment system with information such as your debit or credit card

          settings, as well as characteristics, application crashes, advertising identifiers (for example, AAID for

          your device), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with
          cookies or other technologies that can identify your personal device or browser (for example, IMEI / UDID and

          strength;o information about your device’s sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and compasses.
          • Other information provided with your consent. After receiving your permission, we can determine your exact
          location (latitude and longitude) using various means, the choice of which depends on which services and

          use through your browser settings and other tools.
          Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a Do Not Track (“DNT”)
          feature that tells the website that the user does not want their online activity to be tracked. If a website
          that is responding to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting
          certain information about the browser user. Not all browsers offer the DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet
          unified. For this reason, many businesses are currently unresponsive to DNT signals.</li>

          • Access / update tools in the service.
          Account tools and settings through which you can access, correct or delete information provided to us and
          associated with your account.
          • Device permissions.
          Mobile platforms have permission systems for certain types of data and device notifications (permissions for
          phonebook services, location information, and toast notifications). You can change the settings on your device
          to enable or disable the collection of relevant information or the display of relevant notifications. A ban
          may lead to a limitation of the functionality of some services.
          • Removal.
          You can delete your account using the corresponding function of the service.
          We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are some key points to keep in mind:
          • Verification of information.
          Laws governing the processing of personal data may give you the right to request the information we hold about
          you (depending on the jurisdiction, this can be called the right to access and verify the completeness and
          accuracy of the information).
          • Updating information.
          If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we no longer have the right to use
          it, and if you want to request its correction, deletion or restriction, please contact us.
          For the protection and safety of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can
          respond to the above requests.
          BUT we DO NOT COLLECT personal information about users, our application is an anonymous social questionnaire.
          Please be aware that we may reject requests for specific reasons, including if the request is illegal or may
          violate trade secrets, intellectual property, or voting privacy.
          In addition, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests that object to the processing of personal
          information, especially in cases where such requests will prevent us from providing our services to you. For
          example, we cannot provide you with our service if we do not have your geolocation.
          • Removing the application.
          You can stop the application from collecting information by uninstalling it in the standard way for your
          device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device
          will be saved. After installing the app on the same device, we can re-associate this ID with your previous
          transactions and activities.
          • A responsibility.
          In some countries, including the European Union, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate
          data protection authority if you have any doubts about how we process your information. The body that controls
          the processing of personal data is located at your place of residence, work or at the place of our
          registration.</li>
        <li>How we protect your data
          We make every effort to protect you from unauthorized access or modification, disclosure or destruction of
          your personal information. As with all technology companies, while we take steps to keep your information
          secure, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect your profile information to remain secure at
          all times.
          We regularly review our systems for potential vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly review our methods of
          collecting, storing and processing information in order to update our physical, technical and organizational
          security measures.
          We have the right to suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or discover
          any security breach. If you believe your account or information is no longer secure, please let us know
          immediately.
          To protect our systems and data from unauthorized access, theft and loss, we have not implemented any
          programs, sorry.</li>
        <li>How long do we keep your data
          We retain your data for as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as set out in Section 5) and
          in accordance with applicable legal requirements. To ensure the protection and security of our users inside
          and outside our service, we implement a “security window” for storing data — three months after the account is
          deleted. During this period, the account information will be retained, although the account will of course not
          be visible on the services.
          In practice, we delete or anonymize your information when your account is deleted (after a security window) or
          after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:</li>
        <li>we must keep it in accordance with applicable law (for example, some “traffic data” is stored for one year
          to comply with data retention obligations under the law);</li>
        <li>we must keep it as evidence of our compliance with applicable laws (for example, records of consent to our
          terms, privacy policy and other similar agreements are kept for five years);</li>
        <li>there is an unresolved issue, demand or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until
          resolved; or</li>
        <li>Information must be stored for our legitimate business interests, such as preventing fraud and improving the
          protection and safety of users. For example, information may be required to prevent a user from opening a new
          account who has been denied user rights due to unsafe behavior or security incidents.
          Please be aware that although our systems are designed to perform data deletion processes in accordance with
          the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a certain period of time due to
          technical limitations or world situations, natural disasters.</li>
        <li>Protecting children’s privacy
          Our services are provided only to users aged 18 and over. We do not allow anyone under the age of 18 to use
          our platform, and we knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect
          the user is under the age of 18, use the reporting mechanism available on the service.</li>
        <li>Changes to privacy policy
          As we are always looking for new and innovative ways to support the creation of more accurate anonymous user
          survey statistics, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take
          effect so that you have time to review the changes.</li>

        <li>Shopping.
          General Provisions.
          Sober may periodically offer paid products and services (“in-app purchases”) through iTunes, Google Play,
          mobile operator, Sober payment service, or other payment platforms authorized by Sober. To make an in-app
          purchase, you will need to confirm the payment with the relevant payment operator and the selected payment
          method (bank card or third-party payment service, for example, Google Play or iTunes) (hereinafter — the
          “payment method”); this payment method will be used to write off the cost of the service selected in the
          application, including all necessary fees and taxes. By confirming the payment, you give Sober or the
          third-party payment service your consent to write off the corresponding amount. If you purchase an
          auto-renewing subscription using the app, the subscription will be charged periodically using your payment
          method until you cancel it. Upon expiration of the initial subscription and subsequent subscription periods,
          it will be automatically renewed for the appropriate period at the price you accepted when you signed up.
          Auto-renewal; automatic payment by card
          The subscription will automatically renew until canceled or suspended. After purchasing a subscription, you
          will be charged a monthly payment amount corresponding to the amount you agreed to at the time of
          subscription; debiting occurs within 24 hours prior to the date of initial payment; payment is made using the
          method selected when subscribing. The payment details of the bank card are saved and further used for
          automatic payment by card in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
          If you disagree with a charge already charged, please send your objection to Customer Support if the charge
          was made directly through Sober, or an appropriate third-party payment service such as iTunes. You can also
          object to the payment by contacting your bank or payment service provider, who will inform you of your rights
          and the established return period.
          You can at any time unilaterally revoke your consent to automatic payment by card in the Settings of Sober or
          the corresponding third-party payment service, however, you are obliged to pay all amounts due at that time.
          To change or cancel your subscription, sign in to your third-party payment provider (or Sober Settings) and
          follow the instructions to unsubscribe (even if you have deleted your account or the Sober app from your
          device). When you remove the Sober account or the Sober application from the device, the subscription is not
          canceled and its validity is not terminated; Sober will continue to charge using the selected payment method
          until the subscription is canceled through Sober or a third-party payment provider account. After canceling
          the subscription, you can continue to use it until the end of the already paid period, after this period the
          subscription is not renewed.
          Additional conditions when sending payments directly to Sober using the selected payment method.
          If you pay to Sober directly, Sober has the right to correct any errors in your billing information even after
          a payment request is sent or a payment is received. If you initiate a refund operation or otherwise cancel a
          payment made using the selected payment method, Sober may immediately terminate your account at its
          discretion.
          You can change the payment method in Sober in the “Settings” section. If the withdrawal failed due to the
          expiration of the payment method, lack of funds, or for other reasons, after which you did not change the
          information about the payment method and did not cancel the subscription, you are responsible for all
          outstanding payments and give us permission to continue withdrawing funds after updating information about the
          payment method. This situation may lead to a change in the dates of debiting your payments. In addition, you
          authorize us to receive an extended expiration and updated number of your credit or debit card from its
          issuer. Payment terms depend on the selected Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you
          and the financial institution, credit card issuer, or provider of another selected payment method. Persons
          residing outside the Americas agree that payment for Sober will be made through Sober.

          use “virtual items”, in particular Statistics (collectively, “Virtual Items”). The balance of Virtual Items
          displayed in an account is not a real balance and does not reflect any stored value. It is actually a measure
          of your license. Failure to use Virtual Items will not charge any fees, but the license granted to you in
          relation to Virtual Items will be terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement if Sober stops
          providing the Service or if your account is closed for other reasons. Sober reserves the right, at its sole
          discretion, to change the cost of access to Virtual Items and / or may distribute Virtual Items either for a
          fee or free of charge. Sober has the right to manage Virtual Items and regulate, control, modify or destroy
          them. When exercising these rights, Sober is not liable to you or third parties. Virtual items can only be
          obtained through the Service. PURCHASING AND RECEIVING VIRTUAL ITEMS THROUGH THE SERVICE IS FINAL AND
          NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision of Virtual Items for use within the Service is a service that takes effect
          immediately upon confirmation of purchase of Virtual Items. YOU AGREE THAT Sober IS NOT OBLIGED TO REFUND THE
          VIRTUAL ITEMS VALUE OR OTHERWISE TO REFUND THE VALUE OF UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS IN ANY CASUAL WELCOME, WELCOME
          AND OTHERWISE.

          the subscription. We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription was requested within fourteen days
          of the transaction, or if such refund is required by the laws of your country.

          important and compelling reason, within 14 days of the start of the subscription in accordance with local

          method, there is no refund fee.
          • You cannot cancel an order for the delivery of digital content transmitted on a non-physical medium if the
          order is processed after receiving your express consent and you have confirmed that you agree with the loss of

          SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE
          EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY.</li>
        <li>Arbitration, class action waiver and jury waiver, user waiver of legal action.
          With the exception of subscribers residing in the European Union, European Economic Area and other countries
          where this is prohibited by applicable law:</li>
        <li>The sole means of resolving any dispute or claim arising in connection with this Agreement (including any
          alleged violations of this Agreement) or the Service is Binding ARBITRATION at the JAMS Arbitration, Mediation
          and Alternative Dispute Resolution Center in accordance with the JAMS Arbitration Rules, with the exception of
          provisions contrary to the provisions of our Arbitration Procedures. The only exception to this exclusivity
          clause is the right of either party to bring separate claims against the other party to the small claims court
          of the applicable jurisdiction, or, if the claim has been filed in arbitration, the respondent may request
          that the case be continued in small claims court if the claim the claim falls under the jurisdiction of the
          small claims court. If an application for referral to small claims court is filed before the appointment of an
          Arbitrator, the arbitration shall be terminated administratively. If a petition for referral to small claims
          court is filed after the appointment of an Arbitrator, the Arbitrator determines whether to proceed with
          arbitration or refer it to small claims court. Such arbitration shall be conducted in writing only, unless you
          or Sober decide to exercise the right to an oral hearing in the presence of an arbitration judge. If you
          choose arbitration or small claims court, you agree not under any circumstances to initiate, support or
          participate in any class action, other legal action, class arbitration or other representative action or
          process against Sober.</li>
        <li>By using the Service, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In this case, YOU REFUSE YOUR RIGHT TO
          APPLY TO THE COURT to make a claim or defense in the framework of the relationship between you and the Company
          (with the exception of issues that may be considered by the small claims court). YOU ALSO WASTE YOUR RIGHT TO
          PARTICIPATE IN CLASS SUITS OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDINGS. If you bring a claim against Sober outside of small
          claims court (and Sober does not file a petition to transfer your claim to small claims court), your rights
          will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT a JUDGE OR JURY, and the Arbitrator will rule on all claims
          and all other issues in connection with the possibility of considering a dispute in arbitration. You have the
          right to a fair hearing by an arbitrator. In general, the Arbitrator has the right to provide all the remedies
          that the court can provide, including the possibility of considering a case out of court (including hearing a
          case out of court based on statements by the parties or considering a case out of court based on statements by
          the parties and evidence presented), however, it should be borne in mind that arbitration in general is a
          simpler and more convenient process compared to court and other forms of legal proceedings. An arbitrator’s
          decisions can be enforced in court and can be overturned by a court for limited reasons. For information on
          the arbitration process, please see our Arbitration Procedures.</li>
        <li>Any litigation for the purpose of enforcing this arbitration agreement, including any litigation for the
          purpose of confirming, modifying or exempting from enforcement of an arbitral award, may be commenced in any
          court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable for
